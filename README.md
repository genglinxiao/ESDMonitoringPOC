# ESDMonitoringPOC
This is a repository to store all the code for a minimalist monitoring system for Energy Storing Devices, including a mockup database design, python code for a micro-service for querying hardware information, design documents and configuration files for the monitoring, C# code for data collection on the devices and various scripts for building the solution.
In theory, people should be able to setup a working monitoring system out of the code and documentations from this repository.
